# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

In this app, I have built a small chat app.

User can log in login.html
After login-in, user are moved to channels.html
In channels page, user can create new channel and join any existing channel
A channel has a unique name.
When a user select a channel, he is moved to the channel page.
In channel page, users can speak to each other. Only 100 messages are saved.
